# Concentration - Memory Game

Inspired by [memory-game](https://github.com/marco-colonna/memory-game), concentration is a memory game written in Python.

## Description

```
This is a memory game in which you guess two cards.
If the faces of the cards match, you win the pair,
and they remain face up. Don't waste a turn!
```
